   e.g. "mode tunnel" or "mode transport".

1.068     2013-03-07 17:34:18 Europe/Berlin

Bug fix realease

- Fixed ACL approve for IOS.
  Some IOS commands need to be called with "do" prefix,
  because conf mode is entered earlier since support for NX-OS was added.

1.067     2013-03-06 15:50:23 Europe/Berlin

- Ignore that VRFs of a device which are not found 
  in the config file from Netspoc.
  This allows to have mixed managed and unmanaged VRFs on the same device.

  - Uses "configure session"
  - Interface mgmt0 is located in management VRF by default
- Added support for object-groups of IOS.
- No longer re-read config of IOS after "write mem".
  It is sufficient to check the '[OK]' message.
- missing-approve now compares .raw files if available.
- Code cleanup.

1.065     2012-12-05 17:11:54 Europe/Berlin

- Fixed bug when generating object-group name in ACL.
  There was a bug,
  - when transferring an ACL
  - which references two object-groups,
  - where both object-groups are already available on device
  - and the netspoc name of dst object is identical to 
    the device name of the src object.
  In this case a wrong ACL was transferred: src and dst were swapped.

  This doesn't matter, because we check the result of "write mem" anyway.

- Change interpreter back to perl (was env perl)

1.058     2012-09-19 17:29:57 Europe/Berlin
