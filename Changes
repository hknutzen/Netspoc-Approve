   - An inserted or deleted ACL entry accidentally used a decremented
     line number if a leading ACL entry was already moved.
   - Timeout message is ignored if device is unreachable and

   of IP addresses.
   Each address in server_ip_list is compared with value of
   Policy_distribution_point in code file from Netspoc, to decide
   if the policy distribution point will be used as a proxy server
   to reach a destination.
   If server_ip_list is not set, no proxy server is used or will
   be configured in .ssh/config .

   This is done to prevent accidental lock out from device,
   if the device is accessed via an ESP/AH tunnel.
 - Twice NAT command of ASA >= 8.4 isn't touched by approve any longer.
   Twice NAT and the corresponding "network object" commands
   have to be configured manually now.

1.103     2015-09-22 16:54:12+02:00 Europe/Berlin

 - No longer show annoying 'PROCESS/Change' messages when approving
   Cisco firewall.
 - Prepare for upcoming change of Netspoc to two pass compiler:
   - Ignore any file with extension in pxx/code, not only *.raw files.
   - newpolicy.pl
     - adds symlink pxx+1/code/.prev pointing to pxx/code

 - Fixed bug where tunnel-group with IP address occosionally was
   tried to define twice.
   This occured if a corresponding tunnel-group-map was added.

1.099     2015-06-29 11:40:47+02:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Crypto commands for IOS are assumed to be configured mostly manually now.
   This allows to process devices with IKEv2 configuration.
   - Existence is checked for
     - 'crypto map ipsec-isakmp' and
     - 'crypto ipsec client'.
   - Filter ACLs of crypto maps are compared and updated.
   - All other crypto commands and their sub commands are ignored and
     left unchanged.

1.096     2015-01-22 10:59:03+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Approve won't check interfaces if generated config
   contains no interfaces at all. This occurs for device with
   "managed=routing_only".
 - Added support of 'remark' lines in ACLs of Cisco IOS.

1.095     2014-11-26 18:17:44+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed warning, when reading empty status file.

 - Added workaround for bug #100342 in Expect.pm when parsing ouput of
   Linux commands.
 - Added new config option "keep_history".
   This option determines, after how many days old history files are removed.
   The value must be >= 30. Default value is 365.
 - Script "delete-old-policies" now also removes old files
   in "historydir" and "statusdir".

1.092     2014-06-26 14:32:25 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed approve for ASA: Only warn on spare ACL that was
   generated by netspoc.
 - Fixed handling of reload banner by fixing parsing of Cisco prompt.

1.091     2014-06-23 10:16:24 Europe/Berlin

   Ignore valid output of 'verify' command.

1.090     2014-06-16 14:02:18 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed approve for NX-OS.  If 'verify' of configuration session
   fails, the 'abort' command is called now.
 - Fixed 'newpolicy' to recognize removed file.

1.089     2014-05-20 10:21:48 Europe/Berlin

 - Ignore escape sequence following the prompt, when login to Linux device.

1.088     2014-05-19 18:22:47 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed call to "cvs" in newpolicy:
   Must use relative pathname in server mode.

1.087     2014-05-19 17:32:22 Europe/Berlin

 - The command 'newpolicy' copies the newest version of netspoc files
   from repository to a dedicated directory. From there the generated
   code is deployed to devices.

   Until now, only a single user was allowed to invoke 'newpolicy'.
   Others had to wait until the commd had finished. This was annoying
   if code generation from a large configuration needed some time.

   Now, 'newpolicy' can be invoked by multiple users in parallel.
   First it checks, if there are any changes to the repository.
   - If there are no changes, it exits.
   - Otherwise it checks if these changes are already processes by some
     running instance. Then ist shows the output of that instance.
   - If new changes are pending, it first waits for a running instance
     to terminate. After that, a new instance is started
     to process the pending changes.

   'newpolicy' now calls a C-wrapper that in turn calls 'newpolicy.pl'.
   The C-wrapper has been renamed from 'newpolicy' to 'suid-newpolicy'.

   Existing installations should move 'newpolicy' to 'suid-newpolicy'
   before installing this release.

 - 'newpolicy.pl' no longer checks if the 'netspoc' directory of the
   calling user is up-to-date. Only the repository is checked now.

 - 'newpolicy.pl' exits with status code '2', if another instance is
   already running. It no longer prints a message in this case.

 - Minor fixes to suid-newpolicy.

1.086     2014-04-14 15:13:58 Europe/Berlin

 - New config options in /etc/netspoc-approve:
   - timeout: Timeout during session. Default: 60s
   - login_timeout: Timout when establishing session. Default: 3s
   - try_telnet: Try telnet if device isn't reachable by ssh. (Default: unset)
 - Removed option '-t' of command drc3.pl (default was 500s).

1.085     2014-04-11 12:03:25 Europe/Berlin

 - Ping command isn't used any longer to perform reachability check.
   A shorter timeout of 5s ist used now to prevent long wait at initial
   connection.
   This allows us to use the OpenSSH "ProxyCommand" for SSH connections.

1.084     2014-02-10 17:27:23 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed login to Linux devices.
   No longer misinterpret '#' in banner as prompt.

   logon to remote device.
 - Fixed command 'missing-approve' to no longer print duplicate router
   names if both, netspoc file and raw file have changed.

1.082     2014-01-08 11:45:36 Europe/Berlin

 - Added support for attributes 'dns' and 'unidirectional' in twice NAT.
 - Unnumbered interface with name 'mpls' from Netspoc is silently ignored,
   if device has some interface with 'ip mpls'.

1.081     2013-12-10 12:00:17 Europe/Berlin

 - Added support for 'destination static' in twice NAT of ASA 8.4.

1.080     2013-10-29 16:08:25 Europe/Berlin

 - Added support for keyword [APPEND] in raw files.
   This changes the behaviour of ACLs defined after this keyword.
   The ACL is no longer prepended, but it is appended to a Netspoc
   generated ACL. It is appended at the end of an ACL,
   but before the trailing "deny any any" entry from Netspoc.

 - Fixed missing-approve: If last compare found diff and if it occured
   later than last approve, then show missing-approve.

1.079     2013-08-23 14:07:33 Europe/Berlin

 - Urgent bug fix: Startup config with static routes for linux
   is written correctly again. Was broken since version 1.066.
 - Domain-name is ignored now when comparing
   name of device and router name from netspoc.

   - three fields, separated by whitespace: pattern username password
   - If current device name matches pattern, then return username and password.
   - Pattern may contain shell wildcard characters
     * matches zero or more characters
     ? matches one character
   - First matching line is taken.
   Old format is still supported
   - Only a single line with two fields: "username password"
   - is equivalent to "* username password"

1.076     2013-06-20 16:11:19 Europe/Berlin

 - Bug fix: Again read hostname from prompt for PIX.

1.075     2013-06-20 14:30:54 Europe/Berlin

 - Bug fix: Again read hostname from prompt for IOS.

 - Ignore subcommand of "crypto ipsec transform-set"
   e.g. "mode tunnel" or "mode transport".
 - An ACL or object-group which is unrelated to ACLs generated by Netspoc
   isn't removed any longer on ASA and PIX.
   (This is already the default for IOS and NX-OS.)

1.072     2013-04-24 17:28:55 Europe/Berlin

 - Parallel jobs started by commands 'approve-all' and 'compare-all':
   - New optional parameter to change the number of jobs:
     approve-all [parallel-count]
   - Default value has been increased from 10 to 40
 - New config file option "newpolicy_hooks".
   The value is a list of paths to be called
   after successful run of newpolicy.
 - Added newpolicy.pl from Netspoc project.
 - Added scripts "compress-policies" and "delete-old-policies"
   to be called from cron.

- Ignore subcommands of "crypto map ipv6" as well.

1.068     2013-03-07 17:34:18 Europe/Berlin

Bug fix realease

- Fixed ACL approve for IOS.
  Some IOS commands need to be called with "do" prefix,
  because conf mode is entered earlier since support for NX-OS was added.

1.067     2013-03-06 15:50:23 Europe/Berlin

- Ignore that VRFs of a device which are not found
  in the config file from Netspoc.
  This allows to have mixed managed and unmanaged VRFs on the same device.

- Code cleanup.

1.065     2012-12-05 17:11:54 Europe/Berlin

- Fixed bug when generating object-group name in ACL.
  There was a bug,
  - when transferring an ACL
  - which references two object-groups,
  - where both object-groups are already available on device
  - and the netspoc name of dst object is identical to
    the device name of the src object.
  In this case a wrong ACL was transferred: src and dst were swapped.

1.064     2012-12-04 14:17:15 Europe/Berlin

- Bugfix: Don't enter configuration mode when comparing.
