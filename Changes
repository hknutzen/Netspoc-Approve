   but abort instead.

3.020     2023-11-13 11:21:42+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed issues in code for ASA:
   - Order of two adjacent ACL lines accidentally was swapped if first
     line was moved and second one was inserted.
   - An inserted or deleted ACL entry accidentally used a decremented
     line number if a leading ACL entry was already moved.
   - Timeout message is ignored if device is unreachable and
     'diamonds compare' was called with parameter '--brief'.

3.019     2023-10-26 15:16:42+02:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Use sequence number from 65535 downwards for crypto map dynamic in
   code for ASA. This matches the behaviour of the previous Perl version.

3.018     2023-10-23 15:38:38+02:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Bug fix in migrated code for ASA.
   The bug could occur in this situation:
   Two rules on device reference the same object-group A. These rules
   are changed to reference two different object-groups B and C.  In
   this case the original object-group A may get changed to values of
   both B and C.

3.017     2023-10-18 13:42:00+02:00 Europe/Berlin

   of IP addresses.
   Each address in server_ip_list is compared with value of
   Policy_distribution_point in code file from Netspoc, to decide
   if the policy distribution point will be used as a proxy server
   to reach a destination.
   If server_ip_list is not set, no proxy server is used or will
   be configured in .ssh/config .

   - The device is reached by one of its IP addresses that are given in the
     config generated by Netspoc.
   - The IPs are taken from netspoc topology:
     1. router with attribute 'management_instance'
     2. router with attributes 'management_instance' and 'backup_of'.
   - The API-key must be generated manually and
     put together with corresponding user name into file .aaa_credentals
   - The device config is read from candidate config.
   - A Vsys is only touched if its <display-name> contains string "netspoc".

     - rules with attribute </APPEND> are appended instead
   - Device config is logged in file DEVICENAME.config
   - Sent commands and response from device is logged in

 - Added support for attribute 'extended-key-usage' for ASA.
 - ASA configuration with active 'global access-list' is rejected now,
   because Netspoc generated ACLs are modified in unknown way.
 - For ASA, ACL with 'any' is accepted only from device and from raw file
   for IPv4-only config.
 - Command 'newpolicy' now ignores file '.cvsrc' to better handle
   empty directories in diff.

2.000       2018-03-12 11:28:02+01:00 Europe/Berlin

1.108     2016-03-04 14:51:13+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Support for NAT commands (nat, global, static) has been dropped
   completely, even for Cisco PIX.

     - 'crypto map ipsec-isakmp' and
     - 'crypto ipsec client'.
   - Filter ACLs of crypto maps are compared and updated.

 - Fixed call to "cvs" in newpolicy:
   Must use relative pathname in server mode.

1.087     2014-05-19 17:32:22 Europe/Berlin

 - The command 'newpolicy' copies the newest version of netspoc files
   from repository to a dedicated directory. From there the generated
   code is deployed to devices.

   Until now, only a single user was allowed to invoke 'newpolicy'.
   Others had to wait until the commd had finished. This was annoying
   if code generation from a large configuration needed some time.

   Now, 'newpolicy' can be invoked by multiple users in parallel.
   First it checks, if there are any changes to the repository.
   - If there are no changes, it exits.
   - Otherwise it checks if these changes are already processes by some
     running instance. Then ist shows the output of that instance.
   - If new changes are pending, it first waits for a running instance
     to terminate. After that, a new instance is started
     to process the pending changes.

   'newpolicy' now calls a C-wrapper that in turn calls 'newpolicy.pl'.
   The C-wrapper has been renamed from 'newpolicy' to 'suid-newpolicy'.

   Existing installations should move 'newpolicy' to 'suid-newpolicy'
   before installing this release.

 - 'newpolicy.pl' no longer checks if the 'netspoc' directory of the
   calling user is up-to-date. Only the repository is checked now.

 - 'newpolicy.pl' exits with status code '2', if another instance is
   already running. It no longer prints a message in this case.

 - Minor fixes to suid-newpolicy.

1.086     2014-04-14 15:13:58 Europe/Berlin

 - New config options in /etc/netspoc-approve:
   - timeout: Timeout during session. Default: 60s
   - login_timeout: Timout when establishing session. Default: 3s

 - Removed option '-t' of command drc3.pl (default was 500s).

1.085     2014-04-11 12:03:25 Europe/Berlin

 - Ping command isn't used any longer to perform reachability check.
   A shorter timeout of 5s ist used now to prevent long wait at initial

   This allows us to use the OpenSSH "ProxyCommand" for SSH connections.

1.084     2014-02-10 17:27:23 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed login to Linux devices.
   No longer misinterpret '#' in banner as prompt.

   This changes the behaviour of ACLs defined after this keyword.
   The ACL is no longer prepended, but it is appended to a Netspoc
   generated ACL. It is appended at the end of an ACL,
   but before the trailing "deny any any" entry from Netspoc.

 - Fixed missing-approve: If last compare found diff and if it occured
   later than last approve, then show missing-approve.

1.079     2013-08-23 14:07:33 Europe/Berlin

     * matches zero or more characters
     ? matches one character
   - First matching line is taken.
   Old format is still supported
   - Only a single line with two fields: "username password"
   - is equivalent to "* username password"

1.076     2013-06-20 16:11:19 Europe/Berlin

 - Bug fix: Again read hostname from prompt for PIX.

1.075     2013-06-20 14:30:54 Europe/Berlin

   e.g. "mode tunnel" or "mode transport".
 - An ACL or object-group which is unrelated to ACLs generated by Netspoc
   isn't removed any longer on ASA and PIX.
   (This is already the default for IOS and NX-OS.)

1.072     2013-04-24 17:28:55 Europe/Berlin

 - Parallel jobs started by commands 'approve-all' and 'compare-all':
   - New optional parameter to change the number of jobs:
     approve-all [parallel-count]
   - Default value has been increased from 10 to 40
 - New config file option "newpolicy_hooks".
   The value is a list of paths to be called

- Ignore subcommands of "crypto map ipv6" as well.

1.068     2013-03-07 17:34:18 Europe/Berlin

Bug fix realease

- Fixed ACL approve for IOS.
  Some IOS commands need to be called with "do" prefix,
  because conf mode is entered earlier since support for NX-OS was added.

1.067     2013-03-06 15:50:23 Europe/Berlin

- Ignore that VRFs of a device which are not found
  in the config file from Netspoc.
  This allows to have mixed managed and unmanaged VRFs on the same device.

- missing-approve now compares .raw files if available.
- Code cleanup.

1.065     2012-12-05 17:11:54 Europe/Berlin

- Fixed bug when generating object-group name in ACL.
  There was a bug,
  - when transferring an ACL
  - which references two object-groups,
  - where both object-groups are already available on device
  - and the netspoc name of dst object is identical to
    the device name of the src object.
  In this case a wrong ACL was transferred: src and dst were swapped.

1.064     2012-12-04 14:17:15 Europe/Berlin

- Change interpreter back to perl (was env perl)

1.058     2012-09-19 17:29:57 Europe/Berlin
