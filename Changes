1.069     2013-03-12 14:51:45 Europe/Berlin

- New command "approve-all"
  Approves all devices shown by missing-approve.
  "diamonds approve" is called with new option --brief

Bug fix realease

- Fixed ACL approve for IOS.
  Some IOS commands need to be called with "do" prefix,
  because conf mode is entered earlier since support for NX-OS was added.

1.067     2013-03-06 15:50:23 Europe/Berlin

- Ignore that VRFs of a device which are not found 
  in the config file from Netspoc.
  This allows to have mixed managed and unmanaged VRFs on the same device.
- Ignore "crypto map ipv6" when parsing IOS config.

1.066     2013-02-19 14:29:54 Europe/Berlin

- Added support for NX-OS of Cisco Nexus devices.
  - ACL, object-groups, routing, VRF
  - Uses "configure session"
  - Interface mgmt0 is located in management VRF by default
- Added support for object-groups of IOS.
- No longer re-read config of IOS after "write mem".
  It is sufficient to check the '[OK]' message.
- missing-approve now compares .raw files if available.
- Code cleanup.

1.065     2012-12-05 17:11:54 Europe/Berlin

- Fixed bug when generating object-group name in ACL.
  There was a bug,
  - when transferring an ACL
  - which references two object-groups,
  - where both object-groups are already available on device
  - and the netspoc name of dst object is identical to 
    the device name of the src object.
  In this case a wrong ACL was transferred: src and dst were swapped.

1.064     2012-12-04 14:17:15 Europe/Berlin

1.060     2012-11-12 12:36:47 Europe/Berlin

- No longer compare running with startup config
  This doesn't matter, because we check the result of "write mem" anyway.
