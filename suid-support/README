README for SUID support

approve.pl writes log, history and status files
to different directories.
If approve.pl is called by different users,
each user needs to have write access to these directories.

For auditing it may be required, that no user can alter
any previously written log/history/status entries.

To achieve this,
- Create a dedicated user <X>, which owns netspocdir, statusdir and historydir.
- You need a wrapper script "diamonds" which calls approve.pl
  with the effective user ID of <X>.
- Create "diamonds" by these commands:
    make
    cp diamonds /usr/local/bin
    chown <X>: /usr/local/bin/diamonds
    chmod ug+s /usr/local/bin/diamonds
