README for sudo configuration

Programs newpolicy.pl and approve.pl write files to directories
netspocdir, statusdir and historydir.
If these programs are called by different users,
each user would need to have write access to these directories.

For accountablity reasons, files written to these dirtectories
must not be changeable by an individual user.
We use "sudo" to restrict access to these directories by only those two programs.

To achieve this,
- Create a dedicated user <X>, which owns netspocdir, statusdir and historydir.
- Add this user to /usr/local/etc/netspoc-approve as
    systemuser = <X>
- A wrapper script "sudo-newpolicy" calls "sudo -u <X> newpolicy.pl".
- A wrapper script "diamonds" calls "sudo -u <X> approve.pl".
- Add two entries to your /etc/sudoers file:
    ALL ALL = (<X>) NOPASSWD : /usr/local/bin/newpolicy.pl
    ALL ALL = (<X>) NOPASSWD : /usr/local/bin/approve.pl
