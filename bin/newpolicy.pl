# Description:
# Integrates NetSPoC with version control / build management.
# The current user must have a working directory 'netspoc'
# in his home directory with NetSPoC files checked out
# from the CVS repository.
# - identifies the current policy from policy db
# - calculates the next policy tag
# - extracts newest configuration from repository into policy database
# - checks if working directory of current user
#   - is identical to extracted configuration,
#   - then we know, it is updated and all changes are commited, 
#   - aborts if not
# - compiles the new policy
# - tags extracted configuration with new policy tag
# - marks new policy in policy db as current
#
