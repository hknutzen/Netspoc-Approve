=head1 NAME

newpolicy.pl -- Checkout configuration from Netspoc for Approve

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Integrates NetSPoC with version control / build management.
- creates a new directory 'next' in policy db
- extracts newest configuration from repository into 'next'
- identifies the current policy from policy db
- calculates the next policy tag
- compiles the new policy
- renames directory 'next' to name of next policy tag
- marks new policy in policy db as current
