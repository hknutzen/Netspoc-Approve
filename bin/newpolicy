# newpolicy -- Wrapper script for newpolicy.pl or for suid-newpolicy
#
# This script allows multiple users to request a run of newpolicy.pl.
# It handles parallel calls from multiple users.
# It starts only a single process of newpolicy.pl,
# but shows output of running processes to multiple users.
